<ul>
<li>These guidelines apply to maintainers of the wallstation codebase.
Maintainers have commit access to the repository, that means they can merge pull requests opened by contributors. Maintainers guide the balance of the game and review code of contributors to make sure it's up to standard.
If a pull request is proven to be a controversial change IE. there is a lot of downvotes or the maintainer deems it controversial - the maintainer may host a community vote.
How a community vote works: The pull request is test merged onto the server and a vote is called with the &quot;codebase polls&quot; role in the discord channel. The vote stays up for 3 days while it is testmerged and if the change gets over 60% approval - it may be merged.
If the change has less than 60% approval by the end of the vote, then the maintainer may ask for a headcoder opinion, giving the headcoder the final decision on if a change makes it through.</li>
<li>Pull requests should be open for 24 hours before being merged, this is to ensure the community and other maintainers get a chance to look at the pr before it is merged into the codebase.</li>
<li>Mirror pull requests from upstream are excluded from this and can be merged as soon as they are open.</li>
<li>Minor changes to backend code which do not affect the playerbase are excluded from this and can be merged as soon as they are open.</li>
<li>Maintainers may <em><strong>not</strong></em> merge their own pull requests, they will need another maintainer to merge it.</li>
